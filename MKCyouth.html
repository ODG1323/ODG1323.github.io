    <div class="megbiya"><strong> MKC Youth,</strong> a vibrant community dedicated
         to nurturing the spiritual growth of our young members 
         
         and making a positive impact in our town. At MKC Youth,
          we are driven by the belief in the transformative power 
          of faith and service, inspired by the teachings of the 
          Bible. Our mission is rooted in guiding our 
           on their spiritual journey and encouraging them 
            serve others with love and compassion.

        One of the foundational verses that shape our 
         at MKC Youth is found in the book of Matthew,
          chapter 25, verses 35-36. This passage
           emphasizes the importance of serving 
           
           those in need and showing kindness 
           and compassion to others, reflecting
            the core values of our organization.
             We are committed to actively engaging
              with our community through various initiatives
               such as food drives, volunteering at local shelters,
                and providing support to those facing challenges.
                 By following the commandment to love our neighbors 
                 as ourselves, as stated in Mark 12:31, we strive to make 
                 a tangible difference in the lives of those around us.
